Based on the data from the Doodle poll that was sent out earlier this week, the Cybersecurity Club has decided that the best time to meet would be __every Friday from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.__ Thank you to everyone who completed the poll, it is clear that this time best fits the most people possible. The first meeting will be this __Friday, October 1st at 4:00 PM in CF 420.__ We look forward to meeting you all this Friday!
