# Cybersecurity Club is interested in students to join us for the CyberForce competition!
The Department of Energy hosts an annual competition called "CyberForce". This competition focuses on defense and securing networks from attacks as opposed to traditional competitions focused on attack. Last year students were tasked with defending a wind farm and this year we are defending a hydroelectric dam. These scenarios are modeled after real world infrastructure and give students extremely valuable experience. Each team consists of 4-6 students, so the club is looking for 2-4 interested students to participate along with two officers. Registration ends __October 1st!__ so please send a message i our discord if you're interested! For more info on the competition itself see the [CyberForce Website.](https://cyberforcecompetition.com/cyberforce/)
