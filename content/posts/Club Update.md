# The Cyber Security club is back! 
## It's currently being rebuilt by Noah (Co-President), Sid (Co-President), Nathan, and Douglas. We aim to have everything up and running before the first week of class (9/22). Check back here soon for more information on the club, events, and other happenings. Our main method of communication has been [discord](https://wwu2.sharepoint.com/sites/WWUCyberComp/SitePages/Join-the-Western-Washington-Cyber-Security-Club-Discord-Server!.aspx), the link for which can also be found at the [contact](https://wwucyber.com/contact/) and [about](https://wwucyber.com/about) pages. 
## We hope to see you all soon! Thank you.
