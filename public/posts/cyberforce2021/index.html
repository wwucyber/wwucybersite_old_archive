<h1 id="cybersecurity-club-is-interested-in-students-to-join-us-for-the-cyberforce-competition">Cybersecurity Club is interested in students to join us for the CyberForce competition!</h1>

<p>The Department of Energy hosts an annual competition called &ldquo;CyberForce&rdquo;. This competition focuses on defense and securing networks from attacks as opposed to traditional competitions focused on attack. Last year students were tasked with defending a wind farm and this year we are defending a hydroelectric dam. These scenarios are modeled after real world infrastructure and give students extremely valuable experience. Each team consists of 4-6 students, so the club is looking for 2-4 interested students to participate along with two officers. Registration ends <strong>October 1st!</strong> so please send a message in our discord if you&rsquo;re interested! For more info on the competition itself see the <a href="https://cyberforcecompetition.com/cyberforce/">CyberForce Website.</a></p>
