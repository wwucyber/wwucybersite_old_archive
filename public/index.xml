      <description>Cybersecurity Club is interested in students to join us for the CyberForce competition! The Department of Energy hosts an annual competition called &amp;ldquo;CyberForce&amp;rdquo;. This competition focuses on defense and securing networks from attacks as opposed to traditional competitions focused on attack. Last year students were tasked with defending a wind farm and this year we are defending a hydroelectric dam. These scenarios are modeled after real world infrastructure and give students extremely valuable experience.</description>
